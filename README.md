Hi. If you're not common with Django, but want to checkout my project, then-
<ol><b>
<li>Install Python interpreter if you don't have one already.</li>
<li>Clone this repository.</li>
<li>Step into the directory where 'manage.py' is present and execute 'python manage.py runserver' in the command line</li>
<li>Proceed to the link Django sends you ('http://127.0.0.1:8000/' usually, but may differ)</li>
</b></ol>
And that's it. Really simple, isn't it?.<br>
Keep in mind that the work is not even nearly to be done yet, everything you will see on my website may not be the final cut
